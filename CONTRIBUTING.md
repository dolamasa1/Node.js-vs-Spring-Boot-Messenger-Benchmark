# Contributing to Spring Boot vs Node.js Messenger Benchmark

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our performance benchmarking platform! We're building the definitive tool for scientific backend technology comparison.

## 🎯 Our Mission

We provide **accurate, scientific performance measurements** to help developers make informed technology decisions. Our focus is on:

- **Raw performance metrics** without artificial optimizations
- **Real-world messenger application** testing scenarios
- **Multiple backend technology** comparisons
- **Community-driven** benchmarking standards

## 🚀 Priority Contribution Areas

### High Priority 🎯
- **New Backend Implementations** (Go, Python, .NET, etc.)
- **Performance Test Scenarios** (real-world use cases)
- **Raw Performance Optimizations** (algorithm improvements)
- **Scientific Measurement Accuracy** (better metrics, less overhead)

### Medium Priority 📊
- **Frontend Real-time Features** (better WebSocket handling, visualizations)
- **Additional Database Support** (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis)
- **Documentation & Examples** (setup guides, benchmark interpretations)

### Low Priority 🔧
- **UI/UX Polish** (unless it affects performance measurement)
- **Cosmetic Features** (themes, layouts without functional impact)

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Understanding of performance benchmarking principles
- Knowledge of at least one backend technology (Spring Boot, Node.js, etc.)
- Basic understanding of real-time messaging systems

### Development Setup
1. Fork the repository
2. Set up the development environment (see main README)
3. Run existing tests to ensure everything works
4. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`

## 📝 Contribution Guidelines

### Code Standards
- **Performance First**: Any code changes must not negatively impact measurement accuracy
- **Minimal Overhead**: Keep instrumentation and logging lightweight
- **Consistent APIs**: Maintain identical contracts across all backend implementations
- **Scientific Approach**: Document measurement methodologies and potential biases

### Backend Implementation Rules
- All backends must implement the **exact same API contracts**
- No artificial optimizations that wouldn't work in production
- Include proper error handling and validation
- Maintain identical feature sets across implementations

### Testing Requirements
- Performance tests must be reproducible
- Include baseline measurements with changes
- Document test environment specifications
- Ensure statistical significance of results

## 🔬 Performance-Focused Development

### What We Value:
✅ **Raw algorithm improvements**  
✅ **Efficient data structures**  
✅ **Minimal measurement overhead**  
✅ **Accurate timing mechanisms**  
✅ **Real-world workload simulations**

### What We Avoid:
❌ **Artificial benchmarks**  
❌ **Over-optimized synthetic scenarios**  
❌ **Measurement-altering instrumentation**  
❌ **Production-unrealistic configurations**
